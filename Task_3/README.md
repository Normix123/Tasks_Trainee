## Description

This is a simple game "stone, scissors, paper, lizard, Spock".
When run using the command line parameters (hint: these are the arguments of the main or Main method), an odd number> = 3 non-repeating lines 
are passed (if the arguments are set incorrectly, print a neat error message - what is wrong, an example is how it is correct). These lines 
are moves (for example, Rock Paper Scissors or Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11). Victory is defined as follows - 
half of the next wins, half of the previous ones lose (in a circle).
